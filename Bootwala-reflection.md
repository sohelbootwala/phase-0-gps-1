What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	- I had a hard time having the confidence to say if something I commited actually commited. I've been a little nervous using it, because I'm always unsure if I make some permanent changes that hold me back up the road. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What still confuses you about Git?
	-It feels hard to connect the idea of my computer terminal being able to communicate with a website and trusting its ability to track, monitor, and update changes made to things I'm working on. The lack of familiarity makes it feel like nothing is happening when I'm executing commands. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
